# README

This is demo application developed to demonstrate how React works at the
front end with Ruby and PostgreSql on the backend.
Home budget is just complicated enough to allow demo project to cover important
topics - SPA front end, API controllers, db backend, login and crud operations...

* Ruby version - 2.4
* Rails - 5.0.3
* PostgreSql 9.6
* Reactjs
* WebPack
* devise
* materialize css
* babel-loader

  Currently there is a "guest@abc.com" user with equally easy password.

  This is very much work in progress.
